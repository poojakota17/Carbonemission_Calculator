## **SAVE OUR EARTH**
===================

Climate change is a big, alarming issue now-a-days and it is primarily because of carbon emission. With this project we aims to make us aware of the amount of carbon emission (in terms of CO2 equivalent) we do on our part in terms of our daily purchases and food choices and suggest them with choices that could make a change. This is a cloud native serverless application using AWS. Frontend of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Backend is using nodejs.

### **Services Used**
* Cognito							:		Authentication & Authorization
* Lambda  						:		Serverless application
* AWS Amplify  					:		CI/CD deployment &  hosting                 
* Amazon Lex						:		Chatbot for interaction
* DynamoDB						:		Scalable NoSQL Database
* AWS AppSync 					:		GraphQL API based backend
* ElasticSearch Service			:		Indexing and analytics 
* Kibana							:		Visual representation
* Cloudwatch						:		App health monitoring
* SNS							:		Notification for alarm
