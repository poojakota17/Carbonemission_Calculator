# Introduction:
Climate change is a big, alarming issue now-a-days. Due to progression in technologies and capitalism our food consumption and lifestyle has changed drastically over the past few decades. Previously man used to hunt for filling the appetite, now we eat fancy, processed and comfort food which is producing hazardous greenhouse gases which is depleting the Ozone layer and is inducing global warming. Every organic product(Containing HydroCarbons) has its own Carbon Footprint. Carbon footprint is the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted over the life cycle of the product or service, expressed as kilograms of Carbon dioxide equivalent. Due to increase in livestock production, advancement in farming and industrialization food production is increasing, so is the carbon footprint for food production. It is very important to give special attention to the food we consume in order to maintain environmental balance. In our project we are implementing the solution to help people make the better choice in food consumption which is environmentally efficient and produces less Carbon emission.

# Project Idea:
In our project, we have developed a bot to find carbon emission of products. The user has to input the type of item and the quantity and the bot will evaluate the total answer i.e the total amount of carbon emission of those products in kg CO2 equivalent. The user can input a budget for his/her emission and can compare whether he/she exceeds the budget or not. For developing the bot we have used Amazon Lex bot. The userâ€™s records with the items purchased, its quantity, emission, budget are stored in Dynamodb. On each record addition in Dynamodb, lambda is triggered to add the dynamodb streams to elasticsearch cluster. We are then analysing the data about total emissions using Kibana.

With this project we aims to make us aware of the amount of carbon emission (in terms of CO2 equivalent) we do on our part in terms of our daily purchases and food choices and suggest them with choices that could make a change. 

This is a cloud native serverless application using AWS. Frontend of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Backend is using nodejs.
